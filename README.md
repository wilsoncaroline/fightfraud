Background Info
I am Wilson From Toronto, Canada.  A victim of the online fraud scam (kbigll.com) and lost nearly $200,000 dollars.  What I have lost is my entire savings.
 A platform called kbigll.com (now you can see this website cannot even open because they're fraud). claimed they're located in HK and they're the Asia representative of the company called kbi Global Investors Inc ( https://www.kbiglobalinvestors.com/) I reported this fraud and submitted related documents to Toronto 33 Division (with the report# 20-1581431) .  I have attached fraud evidence from meï¼ˆas the fraud victim) for you to see and report them.

(Real KBI Global Investor has posted the warm about this fake platform)
https://www.kbiglobalinvestors.com/fund-centre/usa-canada/strategy-factsheets-cad/ 


this fake platform is claiming that they're under regulation and has the license (https://www.kbigll.com/html/_guan_anquan/). and that's basically how I get scammed.  I am hoping that you would follow up with HK Police to help out the foreign victims like me. and I believe that positive reaction will help to resolve the case.

Summary of what's happening
I am Shuang Wu, a father of 17 months old daughter, a husband who has separated with his wife.   I am also a victim of an online fraud who has lost


over 183,600 Canadian dollars (135,000 USD).  that's my entire money and  counting for selling of my condo     

What did Happen ?

Last Year December 3rd,  a lady called Yiling Zhang (https://www.linkedin.com/in/%E4%BC%8A%E7%8E%B2-%E5%BC%A0-ab1667198/) reached out my linkedin and asked my contact on whatsapp (her Whatsapp contact +60 11-5153 7560).   She represented herself as a Successful Businesswomen and constantly upload photos to boast her financial success. By the time, My living condo with my wife is very small and she lived separately with me to make more rooms for our baby to play and grow.
I have strong mind to give better living place to my family. 

It was about the early January,  YiLing Zhang showed me the "trick" on how she made such good money.  She told me that she was doing the trading and recommended the trading platform kbigll.com to follow up the instruction to do the trading with her and give the better living standard to the family.  I began to raised little doubts about the legitimacy of the platform.  then she disappeared for in about 10 days and come back to have the conversation with me but not mentioning anything in regards to trading.  this action sets my alarm off.

Starting from March, she recommended me with doing the trading on that platform with her again and claim that I don't need to invest money to the platform but just open up a demo account with her to try out.   after the long consideration, I started to follow up with her and open up the demo account to do the trading.  then I see I quickly gained 50% of the profit on demo account within 2 week's time.  Considering the impressive returns and the successful image that she presented to me.  I decided to put some real money investment in.  (By that time, I lost my job already.  My left shoulder lost almost entire functionality from a severe car accidents and temporarily on ODSP)

starting from $3000 as all the money from my checking account as the initial investment, after that I made some money and being successful cash out of $100 dollars.  I pulled entire $3200 money from my RRSP account with sunlife to invest on this platform.  and then the lady constantly suggested me to give more investment to lower the transaction risks and gain more profits to help out my family to buy a bigger living space.  I made the decision to sell my condo on March.  with that, I have more money to invest with her.  then I deposited another $26,000 USD, then $34,000. I see pleasant results, then In June,  she constantly requested me to put more investment in. better for $100,000 dollars.  because there is opportunities in June to double the profits. So I invested last $90,000 USD.   that's all I have.



I then made some money in June, starting in July, I begin to have the problem to cash out money. the platform people always find an excuse to delay the cash-out.  In middle August, she gives the exact opposite "instruction" to let me lose all the money from my account.  I did the research and what I found out is astonishing.  the way how this fake fraud platform to fool people is when the victim like me doing the trading with them. It disconnects with the market data and purposely to manipulate the price to let the victim to gain the profits or lose the money. when the victim is not follow up with them to do the transaction, it's all normal. it's a deliberately made scam.  I realized I lost all the money that I have and I lost the family that I love.  (Attached is all the evidence that I have collected and the photos are showing the way to they scam me and my money)
